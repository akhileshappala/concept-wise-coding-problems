Approach : 
n &1 = will be left most bit of the n  AND operation with 1 ---> which gives 1 if both are same 
so n&1 -- will become 1 and add to total if the bit is 1
n>>>1 -- will move one bit to the right.

public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
     int total = 0;
        while(n!=0){
                total = total + (n&1);
                n=n>>>1;
            
        }
        return total;
    }
}

// we are using hashset in the below approach, where we only need to check whether given sudoko numbers is valid or not
// by checking the rows , columns, 3*3 box without number repetation
// in if conditions, if we are not able to add specific number in row / in column kind of string which means its already present
//so we return false

    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        Set seen = new HashSet();
        for (int i=0;i<9;++i){
            for(int j=0;j<9;++j){
                char number = board[i][j];
                if(number != '.'){
                    if(!seen.add(number + " in row " + i) ||
                      !seen.add(number + " in column " + j) || 
                          !seen.add(number +" in block " + i/3 + "-" + j/3)){

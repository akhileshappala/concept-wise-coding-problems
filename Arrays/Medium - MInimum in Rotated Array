apparoch : the below is the most significant binary search to work on logn 
another method is to 
mid = (left + right) /2
and incre right = mid-1 like that 
below is  little diff


class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
       if(nums == null || nums.length ==0){
           return 0;
       }
        int left = 0, right = nums.length-1;
        
        while(left<right){
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(nums[mid] > nums[right]){
                left = mid +1;
            }
            else{ 
            right = mid;
            }
        }
        return nums[left];
    }
}

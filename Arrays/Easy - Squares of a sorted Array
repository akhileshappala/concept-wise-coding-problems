LInk : https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/

Solution : 
2 pointer solution :
one from start and other from end 
As the array is already sorted  1st element is small ,last one is large
directly we can square and return but negative numbers are present
find the absolute value -- of 1st and last 
compare which is greater -- and assgin to last value of result array
the pointer will move like: one from initial and other from end to check the negative values and square and assgin back


class Solution {
    public int[] sortedSquares(int[] nums) {
        int i, j ;
        int n = nums.length;
        i = 0;
        j = n-1;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        for(int k =n-1;k>=0;k--){
            if(Math.abs(nums[i]) > Math.abs(nums[j])){
                result[k] = nums[i]*nums[i];
                i++;
            }
            else{
                result[k] = nums[j]*nums[j];
                j--;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
